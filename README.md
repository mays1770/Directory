|Recommender System|<div style="width: 500pt"> This project is to design personalized promotions to offer customers for a leading supermarket chain of over 400 stores. These promotions are intended to be used as a more efficient manner of offering discounts to customers, rather than the uniform store-wide promotions that we tend to see regularly. More specifically, we created a full promotion campaign for both Coke and Pepsi Cola, and ultimately decide which campaign should be rolled out for a two-week window. The full personalized promotion includes details about: all customers that will be targeted by the campaign, the soft drink product being offered, and the discount price assigned to each customer. We also generated an estimate of the total discount redemption cost along with the incremental volume as a result of our campaign. </div>|	k-Means / cosine similarity|	Python|	MKT Analytics|	18|	29.6M|	https://github.com/mays1770/RecommenderSystem|
